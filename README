NAME
    POE::Component::IKC::ReallySimple - POE Component for simple
    inter-kernel communication

SYNOPSIS
        use POE qw(Component::IKC::ReallySimple);

        # in server
        poemsg_receive( ReceiveState => sub { print shift; } );
        $poe_kernel->run();

        # in client
        poemsg_send('HI');

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::IKC::ReallySimple tries to make inter-kernel
    communication very simple. POE::Component::IKC is great but it can be a
    lot of setup for simple projects. This module hides the ick and
    complication of inter-kernel messaging.

    The synopsis really says it all. "poemsg_receive" sets a program up to
    receive simple messages. "poemsg_send" sends a message. This is UDP-like
    in that there is no real error checking to ensure the data goes through.
    At this time, there is also no way to tell where your data came from.

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
  poemsg_send

            poemsg_send($data);
            poemsg_send($data,$server_ip);

        Sends a message to a POE program. By default, it is assumed that the
        program is listening on 127.0.0.1. this assumption may be modified
        by passing a second parameter which is a dotted quad ip address.

        Returns 1 if a successful server connection was made. Returns 0 if
        the server could not be contacted.

  poemsg_receive

            poemsg_receive( ReceiveState => \&subroutine );
            poemsg_receive( ReceiveState => \&subroutine,
                                ServerIP => $server_ip,
                              ServerPort => $server_port
                          );

        Listen and wait for incoming messages. "&subroutine" will be passed
        the transmitted data when a message is received. The only guarantee
        about the incoming data is that it is a defined scalar.

        Parameters: "ReceiveState" takes a code reference which will receive
        passed data as indicated above. This parameter is not optional.
        "ServerIP" sets the ip address to which the server binds. This
        parameter is optional and defaults to "127.0.0.1". "ServerPort" set
        the socket port to which the server binds. This parameter is
        optional and binds "31338".

        "$poe_kernel->run()" must still be done in the server. sometime
        soon, this will be a little bit easier.
